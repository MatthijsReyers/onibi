# Features yet to be implemented:

 - Rule based email sanitizer that can be configured with rules to only allow certain top level 
    domains and disallow certain domain names etc.

 - To lowercase functions currently all use the local of the global environment, it should be 
    researched whether this is ideal or not. 

 - Add resolve promises option to allow the automatic resolving of async values?
